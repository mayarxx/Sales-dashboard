### Sales-dashboard
my latest project in Excel where I applied all the techniques I learned during my journey in diving into Excel, creating two dashboards for work sales analysis to comprehensive all the details regarding the sales from 2005 to 2008.

The analysis process included cleaning, organizing and selecting the necessary data in power query before visualizing the data. It also included data modeling and finding out the relationships between the tables in a manner to connect all the details. And finally using Dax formulas 

While selecting the necessary data, it was crucial to have other few columns to add more meaning like total revenue, cost of goods sold and profit.

The Time frame dashboard includes:

1)KPIs comparison to previous year regarding total quantity, COGS, revenue, profit, profit margin and number of transactions.
 2)Yearly performance metrics (above average year) for total revenue, profit and transactions.
3)Monthly profit trends.
4)Profit by weekdays and weekends.
5)Quarterly profit analysis.

The Details dashboard includes:
üì¶ Products analysis
1)Top 5 profitable products as percentages of total profit.
2)Number of total products, the sold and unsold ones.
3)Profit by products' color.
4)Splitting the prices into two categories, expensive and less expensive depending on a specific criteria to have a specific strategy for the pricing category.

üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customers analysis
1)Top 5 profitable customers according to their percentage share of the total profit.
2)Profit by age group to understand the age of people that contributes the most to our profit with additional information of the products they purchase and most favorable colors.
3)Profit by gender, which shows a slight bit of difference between the two genders.
4)A more detailed visualization to show the most profitable age group that contributes the most to the profit.
5)Country wise profit map, with more details of profits for each country in a specific year.

‚ùî Questions to be answered:
üîµ How are we doing from the current year to the previous year?
üîµ What are the strength of the company regarding the aspects discussed?
üîµ Do our products match the audience?
üîµ Are we doing good with respect to other countries? by how much?
